# WhatToDo

## Are you bored?
Don't know where to look? Don't know what to do?
Stop looking! We have an app to do it for you!


## What is WhatToDo?
WhatToDo is an app that will give you events near **you** that fit **you**. WhatToDo starts off by asking you a few questions
to categorize you under the Big 5 Personality Traits. *(read more at https://www.verywellmind.com/the-big-five-personality-dimensions-2795422#:~:text=These%20five%20primary%20personality%20traits,openness%2C%20conscientiousness%2C%20and%20neuroticism.)*
Then, we will find something catered to your interests and personality and suggest upcoming/ongoing events near you!

## What if I want to stay inside, but I'm still bored?
No worries! WhatToDo works with *everyone*. We will suggest you virtual events that still fall under your interests and personality.

## Can I use this?
Currently, we are in the early stages of development and this will only be able to work if you are in Arlington, Texas.
